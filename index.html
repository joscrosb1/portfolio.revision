        <h2 class="text-centered"> About Me </h2>
        <p class="text-centered">I lived in NYC all 
         my life, working from job to job making little 
         money in a expensive city. I wanted to change my 
         life and switch to an actual career path. Thats 
        when I looked into Thinkful, a cooding bootcamp 
        that provides 5  months of teaching the skills for 
        a full-stacker. During these 5 months, it a was 
        quite a journey but an amazing learning 
        experience. I truly have a passion for solving 
        problems and building a beutiful  well design 
        websites. It helped me grow into a  better person 
        interacting with others, building  new  skills, a 
         basically learning how to code. My other interest 
        would be anime and video games.</p>
